Credit Card Fraud Detection and it’s Impacts on Businesses

Summary
Exploratory analysis was done on multiple datasets to gain understanding on data on banking and credit 
card transaction where machine learning models were trained to predict fraud transactions in United States. 
The average accuracy to classify fraud transaction was 71% and its impact on businesses was found to reduce the loss by 20%. 
More than a million of transactions which consists of fraud, location, time and customer ID were analyzed.

Problem Statement

As per reports, retail businesses throughout America, incur losses of millions of dollars due to fraudulent transactions. 
The credit card owner remains in the clear since credit card companies return the amount if the owner flags it as fraud. 
But what if I provided a solution that could reduce these losses for the business and increase the business’s trust in the credit card company who buys my product. 
This increased safety of transactions will increase trust in both a credit card owner and a business in the credit card company. 
The increased trust value will increase sales of their credit card and acceptance of it by the businesses, pushing back all competition easily. 
To turn all of the above into reality, I offer a web interactive dashboard that will flag a possible fraudulent transaction, 
share accuracy of fraud detection and share the relative loss percentage to business with the credit card company.
